Dial Events HWA Sample
======================
This sample shows how to integrate the [Microsoft Dial API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/input-and-devices/windows-wheel-interactions) into a Hosted Web App on Windows 10 Anniversary edition (or higher).

**This Sample Demonstrates the following:**

* Changing Default System Menu Items
* Responding to Press and Rotation Events
* Adding Custom Items from Image Files

### Custom Icons
When building a custom icon for a dial interaction, create a 64x64 transparent PNG.

It should be white in the foreground with a black border (for high contrast mode).

I found a border of 2px worked well with a margin of 7px per edge before image content.
